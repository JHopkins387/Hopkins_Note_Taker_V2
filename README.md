# Note Taker Starter Code

  ## Description: 
  Application that can be used to write and save notes

  ## Installation: 
  Clone the repository. User types 'node server' in the command line to start the server. Add and delete notes as you wish.
## Task

I was tasked with creating a program that was called Note Taker that allows a user to write and save notes.  It would be programmed so it would keep what you have written saved even if you close out of the window.  This would allow you to come back to it later and add more as needed without losing older information that was entered.
